    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>\ What I am working towards in my future professional life is to have the experience to go pro in lacrosse. I am working to these goals by simply working harder to fall in love with the work ethic putting in everything I can in practice and in a game. Some values I consider most necessary for my success in going pro is to work on my foot work not giving up or getting upset when I mess up just moving forward deciding what is the next right step. Working on my stick work and running to the ball, understanding the game and plays as depth as it can get. Short term goals that I would like to accomplish in the near future is to work harder than everyone else in practice so I can earn my starting spot for varsity cause if I don't do nothing I wont just get the spot I want handed to me. I have worked really hard to make varsity as a freshman and I need to work harder to start in the spot cause it is all about your mentality and what is "The Next Right Step" and if I am giving up my spot can be taken away and all my hard work has to reset.  Character traits and achievements I want to be known for is to have at least 25 goals by the end of season I want to be known for uplifting people and wont get mad if they mess up because everyone makes mistakes. I also look up a lot to the seniors and one thing I love that they do is uplifting people cheer them on and teach that is exactly how I want people to see me and learn from my  mistakes and from the things that I do right.</p>
